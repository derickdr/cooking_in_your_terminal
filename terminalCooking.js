/* This project is inspired by Cooking Adventures, which is a catering game wherein you serve customers customized orders 
   with the goal of achieving x gross profit under a time limit. There are many scenarios with different types of cuisine
   and many different ways to prepare food, and your time management / reflexes are very often tested. You are also able 
   to upgrade your kitchen, cookware, product, and even your kitchen. There are also unlockable outfits and the like that
   I will not be implementing in this terminal edition. */
